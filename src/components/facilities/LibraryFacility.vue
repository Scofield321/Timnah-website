        <p>
          At <strong>Timnah</strong>, we regard the Library as the focal point
          of the learning experience, providing children and staff with
          information and reading materials, as well as teaching and learning
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Libraries are the hub of our school and they are extremely well
          stocked with resources. They are particularly successful in providing
          a warm and comfortable environment for reading and information
          sourcing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is always a librarian to assist with finding information from
          the different resources in the library. Library is open from 8.00amâ€“
          4.00pm on weekdays and 9.00am-2.00pm on Saturdays
